            <h2>INTRO TO VECTOR SPACES: </h2>
            <p>Let's first define what is actually meant by a vector space. The idea is that it's a collection of vectors in which two operations, vector addition 
            \(\textbf{v} + \textbf{w}\) and scalar multiplication \(a\mathbf{v}\), are defined and also have their familiar properties of associativity and 
            commutativity in a vector space \(\textbf{U}\): </p>
            
            <h5><b>VECTOR ADDITION</b></h5>
            <p>For all vectors \(\textbf{v}, \textbf{w}, \textbf{u}\) in \(\textbf{U}\) we have 
                <ol>
                    <li>The sum \(\textbf{v} + \textbf{w} \in \textbf{U}\) (Closure under vector addition)</li>
                    <li>\(\textbf{v}\) + \(\textbf{w}\) = \(\textbf{w}\) + \(\textbf{v}\) (Commutative law)</li>
                    <li>\(\textbf{v} + (\textbf{w} + \textbf{x}) = (\textbf{v} + \textbf{w}) + \textbf{x}\) (Associative law) </li>
                    <li>\(\textbf{0} + \textbf{v} = \textbf{v}\) (Additive element, the zero vector \(\textbf{0}\))</li>
                    <li>\(\textbf{v} + (-\textbf{v}) = 0\) (Additive inverse, the negative vector \(-\textbf{v}\))</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                <h5><b>SCALAR MULTIPLICATION</b></h5>
                For all vectors \(\textbf{v}\), \(\textbf{w}\) in \(\textbf{U}\) and scalar \(a, b \in \mathbb{R}\) we have 
                <ol>
                    <li>\(a \textbf{v} \in \textbf{U}\) (Closure under scalar multiplication) </li>
                    <li>\(a \cdot (\textbf{v} + \textbf{w}) = a \cdot \textbf{v} + a \cdot \textbf{w} \) and \((a+b) \cdot \textbf{v}
                     = a \cdot \textbf{v} + b \cdot \textbf{v}\) (Distribute over scalar multiplication) </li>
                    <li>\(a \cdot (b \cdot \textbf{v}) = (a \cdot b) \cdot \textbf{v}\) (Associative law) </li>
                    <li>\(\textbf{v} \cdot 1 = \textbf{v}\) (Multiplicative inverse) </li>
                </ol>
                Due to the property of real numbers, we have that \(\mathbb{R}^n\) is a vector space.

            <p>
                <h2>VECTOR SUBSPACES</h2>
                Now onto a related topic: vector subspaces. These are essentially 'smaller parts' of a larger vector space in that any vector 
                \(\textbf{v}\) that is in a subspace \(W\) will also be in the actual vector space \(U\). Therefore, we can state that \(W \subseteq U \). 
                Following this idea, we define a subspace \(W\) as any subset of a vector space \(U\) which satisfies the following key properties:
                <ol>
                    <li>\(W\) contains the zero vector \(\mathbf{0}\)</li>
                    <li>Any two vectors \(\textbf{v}\) and \(\textbf{w}\) in \(W\) will also have their sum \(\textbf{v} + \textbf{w}\) in \(W\). (Closure under vector addition)</li>
                    <li>If the vector \(\textbf{v}\) is in \(W\) then any scalar multiple, \((a \textbf{v}, a \in \mathbb{R})\) of that vector will also be in \(W\)</li>
                </ol>
                An immediate consequence of the above defintion of a vector subspace (specifically points 2. and 3.) is that any linear combination of vectors \(\{v_1, v_2, . . ., v_n\}\) in \(W\) will
                also be in \(W\). Hence, we have the following trivial, but important theorem:
            </p>
            
            <div class = "theorem">
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">THEOREM I:</h3>
                $$ \textrm{For any set of vectors } \{\textbf{v}_1, \textbf{v}_2, . . ., \textbf{v}_n\} \textrm{ in a vector space, we have that any linear combination of these vectors } a_1\textbf{v}_1 + a_2\textbf{v}_2 + . . . + a_n\textbf{v}_n
                \textrm{ is also in} \mathit{W}. $$
            </div>
            
            <p>Let us apply our working knowledge of vector spaces and subspaces to real examples of vector sets: </p>
            
            <h3>EXAMPLES</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                Define the first quadrant of \(\mathbb{R}^2\) as \(\{(x, y ) \, | \, x, y \geq 0\}\). We note that this is not a subspace of the vector space \(\mathbb{R}^2\) 
                since scalar multiplication of either the \(x\) or \(y\) leads to a negative coordinate that is not in the first quadrant. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Define \(\textrm{null } A\) of an \(m \times n\) matrix \(A\) as the set of all vectors \(\textbf{x}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^n\) such that \(A\textbf{x} = \textbf{0}\).
                    This is a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) because the zero vector is trivially in this vector set. Additionally, subspace statements 2. and 3. follow from
                    the distributive and associative properties of matrix multiplication respectively.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Define \(\textrm{im } A\) of an \(m \times n\) matrix \(A\) as the set of all vectors \(\textbf{y}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^m\) such that \(\textbf{y} = A\textbf{x}\)
                    for some vector \(\textbf{x}\). (In other words, the range of a matrix \(A\).) This is also a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^m\) as the zero vector is  
                    trivially in it; and statements 2. and 3. regarding the definition of vector subspaces once again follow from the distributive and associative properties of matrix multiplication. That is, \(\textbf{y}_1 = A\textbf{x}_1,
                    \textbf{y}_2 = A\textbf{x}_2 \implies (\textbf{y}_1 + \textbf{y}_2) = A(\textbf{x}_1 + \textbf{x}_2)\) and \(\textbf{y} = A\textbf{x} \implies a\textbf{y} = aA\textbf{x} = A(a\textbf{x})\).<br>
                    <b>REMARK: </b> This and the above example apply to linear transformations \(\textrm{T: } \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n\) wherein the 
                    equivalent of \(\textrm{null } A\) is simply \(\textrm{ker T}\) and \(\textrm{im } A\) is equivalent of  \(\textrm{range T}\) so that we can establish
                    that \(\textrm{ker T}\) is a subspace of the domain of \(\textrm{T} = \mathbb{R}^m\) and \(\textrm{range T}\) is a subspace of the codomain of \(\textrm{T}
                    = \mathbb{R}^n\).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Any line or plane passing through the origin is also a subspace of \(\mathbb{R}^3\). In the case of lines, adding any two points on a line gives another point
                    on the line as they are all parallel to each other: \(\textbf{y} = t\textbf{x} \implies \textbf{y}_1 + \textbf{y}_2 = t(\textbf{x}_1 + \textbf{x}_2)\) and similarly
                    for scalar multiplication. In the case of a plane, we can see that any point on a plane can be written as a linear combination of two vectors that are already in it as seen in the image  below.
                    Then all axioms of a vector subspace trivially follow from the associative and distributive properties of vector algebra. <img src = "plane.jpg" align = "right">
